 * This project shows the polling on hardware timer solution.
 * The RB15 timing is still not perfect, but the mean value of its period
 * is correct.
 * 
 * We want to create a 50kHz square wave on RB15.  Our code also need to
 * execute aLongTask().  This function will mess with the timing of our signal.
 * RB13 is toggled before calling aLongTask() to see its execution time.
 * As the execution time of the T1IF polling is very small in comparison,
 * it's more readable on the ocilloscope.
